It takes an airplane to get a person across the world - but a world of great minds to get an airplane off the ground
Today it is normal to step on a modern airplane and travel the entire globe within 24 hours. But it still takes hundreds of experts and specialists to get such an airplane ready for take-off. TTTech is on board too. If you come work with us in Vienna, so are you.
